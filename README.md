# bwbingo
A buzzword bingo (aka bullshit bingo) webapp written in Flask. Just a programming practice but it works.

## Todo
 * ~~delete buzzwords from the list~~
 * ~~after adding a buzzword with pressing enter you should be able to type in the next one right away (without clicking on the text field)~~
 * ~~permalinks to bwLists~~
  * this is being implemented by storing the complete list of buzzwords in the URL which is cool because just with the link you've got everything you'll ever need. However there might be limits to what server and browser accept in terms of URL length! [relevant info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers)
 * ~~make a bingo table from the bwList~~
 * interactive bingo table for playing in the browser
 * nice printing for playing on paper
 * Some CSS and possibly jQuery for eye candy
